CHAPTER ONE                                       INTRODUCTION



1.1.	 Research Background

Perbadanan Usahawan Nasional Berhad (PUNB) currently operates a paper- based system for the acceptance and tracking of assets. This system requires users to fill in a form whenever an asset is handed over to them. However, this method of tracking assets is prone to errors and inefficiencies, particularly when the original form is missing. This issue has become a growing concern for PUNB, as the loss of assets due to improper tracking and record-keeping has become a serious issue.
The problem of asset mismanagement and loss is further compounded by staff misconduct, including asset misappropriation. According to Tajudin et al. (2022), the root cause of these issues is the inadequate method of recording and tracking assets. In order to address these challenges, PUNB is exploring the implementation of a new system that utilizes QR code technology.
The QR code system will provide a more secure and efficient method of tracking assets, as well as reducing the potential for errors and mismanagement. This will ultimately help PUNB to improve its asset management practices, reducing the risk of asset loss and misappropriation, and improving overall accountability and transparency in the handling of company assets.

The implementation of asset tagging at the Perbadanan Usahawan Nasional Berhad (PUNB) is motivated by the need to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the asset management process. The current paper-based system for tracking assets has proven to be prone to errors, with missing forms and incomplete records leading to issues such as asset loss and mismanagement. Asset misappropriation and loss have become a growing concern for PUNB, with staff misconduct being a significant contributor to these issues. By implementing an asset tagging system that utilizes QR code technology, PUNB aims to improve the tracking and management of its assets, reducing the risk of loss and misappropriation. The implementation of asset tagging at PUNB will also provide benefits in terms of increased efficiency and accountability. With the ability to quickly and accurately track assets using QR codes, PUNB will be able to streamline its asset management processes and improve decision-making with regards to asset allocation and utilization. Furthermore, the asset tagging system will also improve transparency and accountability in the handling of company assets, as all asset-related information can be easily accessed and monitored. This will ultimately contribute to the overall success and sustainability of PUNB as a business. In conclusion, the motivation for implementing asset tagging at PUNB is driven by the need to address the challenges associated with the current paper-based system, and to improve the efficiency, accuracy, and accountability of the asset management process.

1.2.	Problem Statement

Traditional method of recording asset inventory data has been a persistent problem for organizations, especially those with a large number of assets. The manual process of recording each asset and its related information is not only time-consuming but also prone to errors and inaccuracies. The lack of a centralized system to store and manage asset information can result in data loss, incorrect recording, and even duplication of records (Singh & Jain, 2019). This can lead to significant challenges in terms of asset management, as incorrect information can result in incorrect decisions regarding asset allocation, utilization, and replacement (Zhang, Chen, & Du, 2018). Furthermore, the traditional manual approach to asset recording often lacks the necessary level of transparency and accountability, making it difficult to monitor the use and movement of assets within an organization (Ebrahimi & Navi, 2018). This can
lead to asset mismanagement and theft, causing financial losses for the company and reducing its overall efficiency and effectiveness (Nishat, Tariq, & Zaman, 2020). Moreover, the manual process of updating asset information and reconciling records can be a time-consuming task, and the delay in managing the asset record can result in an incomplete picture of the organization's assets (Agrawal & Gupta, 2018). This can hinder effective decision-making and strategic planning, and make it difficult to identify potential issues or opportunities for improvement (Jain & Dwivedi, 2018). In conclusion, the traditional method of recording asset inventory data presents a significant challenge for organizations, leading to problems such as data loss, incorrect recording, and delays in managing the asset record. An efficient and accurate system is needed to address these challenges and improve the overall asset management process (Ebrahimi & Navi, 2018).
